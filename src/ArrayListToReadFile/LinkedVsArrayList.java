/**
 1.LinkedList is faster compared to ArrayList

 2.ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to the
 LinkedList search operation. LinkedList doesn't provide random
 or index based access and you need to iterate over linked list to retrieve
 any element.

 3.LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to ArrayList. ***Might not be?

 4.LinkedList has more memory overhead than ArrayList because in ArrayList
 each index only holds actual object but in case of LinkedList each node holds both
 data and address of next and previous node.
